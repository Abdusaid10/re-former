# Re-former
These projects will give you a chance to actually build some forms,both using nearly-pure HTML and then graduating to using the helper methods that Rails provides. The tutorial chapter will cover integrating a signup form with your Rails application and providing help if the user enters incorrect information.

>In this project, youâ€™ll build a form the old fashioned way and then the Rails way.
## Prerequisite

- Ruby 2.6.3
- Rails 5.2.3

## Getting started


```
git clone https://github.com/Abdusaid10/re-former.git
cd re-former
```

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:

```
bundle install --without production
```

Next, migrate the database:

```
rails db:migrate
```

Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:

```
rails test
```

If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:

```
rails server
```
